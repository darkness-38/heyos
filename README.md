My own AME Wizard playbook for making windows faster and better.

Installs goodbyedpi, activates windows, disables telemetry, cleans storage, makes ui smoother and more appealing, improvers performance with some registry tweaks, disables unnecessary services that cut performance, installs/upgrades drivers.
